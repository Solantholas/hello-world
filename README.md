# hello-world
First repository

Hello everyone!

My name is Corey Hicks! My alias, Solantholas has been around for the past 14 years. I'm new to GitHub but I've been studying software development for the past 3 years. I graduate in July of 2018 with a Bachelors of science. If all goes well, I'll be hosting a few repositories with my portfolio to deliver to future employers!
